        [00:48.80]What's this?
[00:49.80]What's this?
[00:50.48]There's people everywhere
[00:52.02]What's this?
[00:52.88]And they have well-done hair
[00:54.34]What's this?

[00:54.88]I’m not in Montreal
[00:56.06]I must be dreaming
[00:56.76]Tabarnac quelle atmosphère!
[00:58.88]What's this?

[01:01.92]What's this?
[01:02.56]What's this?
[01:03.06]There's something very wrong
[01:04.84]What's this?
[01:05.52]There's people singing songs
[01:06.88]What's this?
[01:07.66]It wasn’t in my full itinerary
[01:09.86]Everybody seems so merry!
[01:11.30]Did they all just make the ferry?
[01:12.90]What is this?
[01:14.62]What's this?

[01:17.26]There are children throwing tantrums 
[01:19.00]But none of them are here
[01:20.40]Instead we have Anton
[01:21.86]Pouring many pints of beer

[01:23.60]The bakeries are missing
[01:25.00]Croissants we cannot find
[01:26.50]But we have ocean all around us
[01:28.00]With mountains, two thousand meters high

[01:32.00]Who’s this?
[01:33.00]It’s Chris! 
[01:34.00]And there is Maia too! 
[01:35.00]They kiss! (горько горько!)

[01:36.00]Why that looks so unique
[01:37.00]Inspired!
[01:38.00]They’ve been practicing for years,
[01:39.00]Their technique doesn’t leave much to be desired!
[01:41.84]What's this?

[01:44.94]What's this?
[01:45.68]Dear friends 
[01:46.34]Let’s introduce the bride, how strange
[01:48.44]She’s biking through the snow
[01:50.02]And why?

[01:50.94]Who knows! But somehow she seems to manage
[01:52.78]Now she’s sequencing a cabbage
[01:54.40]These are good signs for a marriage
[01:55.76]So, now, correct me if I'm wrong

[01:57.42]This looks like fun 
[01:58.00]This looks like fun
[01:58.68]Oh, could we have another kiss? (горько горько!)
[02:00.50]What's this?

[02:03.00]Oh my
[02:04.00]What next?
[02:05.00]It’s time to meet the groom
[02:06.48]He’s boss to those game designers
[02:07.48]He eats just churros cause there’s nothing finer
[02:08.86]works with China, so mature despite the fact
[02:14.02]That he looks baaarely thirteen

[02:20.00]What's this?
[02:23.24]They learned to ski together
[02:24.68]Then one of them gave up
[02:26.20]They learned to brave the weather
[02:27.74]And even got a pup
[02:29.44]They’ve done it all together
[02:30.52]For years and years and years
[02:32.03]And now it’s their wedding
[02:33.50]So cheers and cheers and cheers

[02:37.34]The sights, the sounds
[02:38.82]They're everywhere and all
[02:40.24]Around!
[02:41.18]I've never felt this good
[02:42.42]Before!
[02:43.48]This empty place inside of me is filling up
[02:45.54]I simply cannot get enough
[02:47.12]I want it, oh, I want it
[02:48.48]Oh, I want it for my own
[02:49.82]I've got to know I've got to know
[02:51.24]What is this party I have found?
[02:53.30]What?
[02:53.94]Is?
[02:54.68]This!?
[02:58.34]Christmas town, hmm
